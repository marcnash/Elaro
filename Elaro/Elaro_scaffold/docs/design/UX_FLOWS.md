# UX Flows

## Primary Flow: Add Child → Suggested Milestones → Mark Stages
1. Onboarding: Add child (name, age) → seed age library
2. Library: select milestones to “track now”
3. Child Profile: set stage per milestone (Introduced/Practicing/Independent)
4. Dashboard: see progress + nudges

## Wireframe Inventory (screens)
