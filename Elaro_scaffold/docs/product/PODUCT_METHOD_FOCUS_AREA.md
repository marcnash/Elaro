# Focus Area: North Star & Deck Spec

> **Purpose**
> Define a humane, evidence-aligned method for guiding families with *Focus Areas*, and describe the shallow→deep card stack that keeps daily actions in sync with longer-term growth.

---

## The North Star (plain English)

Use one stable aim as the compass for every card and suggestion: **grow Autonomy, Competence, and Relatedness**. When these needs are supported, motivation and wellbeing improve; when they’re thwarted, both suffer. Elaro’s job is to help families support those needs with tiny, doable steps.

---

## What a Focus Area is

A **Focus Area** is a developmental theme you choose for a period of time—e.g., **Connection**, **Independence**, **Emotion Skills**, **Executive Skills**. You keep **1–2 active** at once (to avoid overwhelm). Each card depth answers a different question and sends signals up/down the stack so the compass stays dynamic.

**Active count guidance**

* **Daily:** 1–2 active Focus Areas (ideal: 1)
* **Weekly:** 1–2 themes (e.g., Connection + Independence)
* **Monthly:** 1 primary, optional secondary

---

## Why layered cards help (parenting method, not just UI)

* **Deep → Shallow:** Longer horizons shape today. If a family’s quarter theme is “more independence,” the **Today** card should surface 1–2 **choice-rich** actions (e.g., “you pick the plan,” “you try first, I’m backup”).
* **Shallow → Deep:** Today reshapes the plan. If daily logs show “child chose the harder option” and stress stayed low, the **Week** card can propose a bigger challenge; if logs show persistent friction, step the scope down and include a short rationale.
* **Autonomy-supportive by default:** Offer **choices and rationale**, not pressure. Provide structure without control.

---

## The Focus Area Deck (shallow → deep)

### 1) **Today in this Focus** (Shallow)

**Purpose:** tiny, doable actions *now* that serve the chosen Focus.
**Shows:**

* One headline prompt (1 sentence): *“Try this today…”*
* **1–3 micro-actions** with a 1‑line **why**
* Optional **variant choice** (e.g., 5/10/20‑minute)
* **Two-tap reflection:** felt difficulty (light/ok/hard) + optional note
  **Parent actions:** pick / complete / snooze; jot a note; bookmark a tip.
  **Learns upward:** completion; chosen variant; felt difficulty; note keywords.
  **Influences downward:** copy tone for the rest of today; tomorrow’s suggestion (easier/harder; more/less novelty).
  **Guardrails:** 15–30s to grok; max **3** actions visible; always offer **choice**.

### 2) **This Week in this Focus** (Mid‑Shallow)

**Purpose:** make sense of the last few days and suggest the next nudge.
**Shows:**

* **1 Win • 1 What’s Hard** (auto-summarized)
* **Suggested tweak:** *Keep / Scale down / Scale up* (with a 1‑line why)
* **Mini‑ritual** for the week (e.g., “2× 5‑min practice”)
  **Parent actions:** tap **Keep** or **Adjust**; pick cadence.
  **Learns upward:** escalate / stay / back off; best time of day.
  **Influences downward:** tomorrow’s bias (e.g., more choice‑making vs more scaffolding).
  **Guardrails:** one screenful; **one** tweak at a time.

### 3) **Monthly Focus Plan** (Mid‑Deep)

**Purpose:** set/refresh the theme with a simple structure.
**Shows:**

* **Focus statement:** “This month we’re building \[Independence] by \[letting them try first].”
* **3 building blocks** (auto‑proposed; editable):

  * **Micro‑skill** (e.g., “Try first; ask for help after”)
  * **Ritual** (e.g., “Weekend outfit choice”)
  * **Support** (e.g., “Lay out two options”)
* Optional **Boundary/constraint** (e.g., “Keep bedtime predictable”)
* **Highlight reel:** 3 photos/notes from the month
  **Parent actions:** accept/edit the 3 blocks; pin 1–2 **priority micro‑skills**.
  **Learns upward:** what the family values and can sustain; where friction happens.
  **Influences downward:** pool of daily actions; tone of the rationale (“why this matters this month”).
  **Guardrails:** exactly **3** editable tiles; defaults pre‑filled.

### 4) **Quarter/Season Pathway** (Deep)

**Purpose:** identity + trajectory—are we becoming who we hoped?
**Shows:**

* **Theme evolution** (e.g., Independence → Self‑management)
* **2–3 competency rungs** touched (simple labels, not scores)
* **Story prompt:** “What surprised you this season?”
* **Next season preview:** 1 proposed focus, 1 thing to keep
  **Parent actions:** a short note (or dictate); accept/adjust next focus.
  **Learns:** what to carry forward; which values are sticky.
  **Influences:** seeds next month’s defaults and the “why” copy for daily prompts.
  **Guardrails:** quarterly is optional; 2–3 minutes; celebrate, don’t audit.

---

## Two‑way flow (feedback loops)

* **Signals that roll upward:** completions, chosen duration, felt difficulty, note keywords → shape the weekly tweak → shape monthly building blocks → inform next season’s suggested focus.
* **Constraints that roll downward:** the current Focus + monthly building blocks bias daily suggestions, language, and timing (e.g., “offer choice first,” “you try, I’ll help after”).
* **Always with choice:** at every layer, parents choose among **2–3 proposals**, not fill forms.

---

## Guardrails that keep it wise

* **Choice > control:** offer options; let the parent (or older child) pick.
* **Effort‑focused language:** praise process, not traits.
* **Emotional integration:** tiny prompts to name/organize feelings; co‑regulate first, coach second.
* **Calm is contagious:** nudge toward a non‑anxious stance; avoid shamey copy.

## Examples

### Focus: **Independence**

**Today:** “You pick the outfit; I’ll set a 3‑minute timer.”
Actions: \[ ] Child chooses first • \[ ] Parent waits before helping • \[ ] Praise effort, not result.
Reflection: *Okay* (note: “chose shirt, needed help with socks”).

**This Week:**
Win: “Chose shirt twice without stress.”
What’s Hard: “Timer felt rushed on school mornings.”
Tweak: keep choice; **drop timer** on school mornings; try timer on weekends.

**This Month:**
Blocks → **Micro‑skill:** “Try first, ask for help after.”
**Ritual:** “Weekend outfit choice.”
**Support:** “Lay out two options.”

**This Season:**
Rungs: “Initiates choice” → “Manages simple sequences.”
Preview: nudge toward **Self‑management** (prep backpack checklist).

### Focus: **Emotion Skills**

**Today:** “Name **your** feeling out loud, invite theirs.”
Actions: \[ ] “I feel… because…” • \[ ] Ask: “What’s your feeling?” • \[ ] Co‑regulate (breathe together).

**This Week:**
Win: “Child named ‘frustrated’ twice.”
Tweak: add a feelings chart to the fridge.

**This Month:**
Blocks → **Micro‑skill:** “Name 3 feelings.”
**Ritual:** “Feelings check‑in at dinner.”
**Support:** “Visual chart.”

**This Season:**
Story: “We started saying our feelings first; meltdowns were shorter.”
Preview: keep Emotion Skills; add **Repair scripts** next season.

## Decisioning (MVP, explainable)

**Inputs we collect**

* **Explicit:** active Focus Area(s); monthly building blocks; daily choice among 2–3 actions; completion; felt difficulty; optional note; weekly Keep/Adjust.
* **Implicit:** when actions succeed; preference for shorter/longer variants; novelty tolerance.

**Daily recommender (ranking)**
Score candidate actions from the Focus library and show the top **2–3**:

```
priorityScore =
  0.35 * FocusMatch
+ 0.20 * SuccessProbability
+ 0.15 * BandwidthFit
+ 0.10 * TimeOfDayFit
+ 0.10 * NoveltyBoost
+ 0.10 * StreakMomentum
- 0.10 * FrictionRisk
```

**Weekly adjuster:** emits exactly **one** suggestion: Keep / Scale down / Scale up (with a 1‑line why).
**Monthly planner:** proposes 3 building blocks; parent accepts/edits.

**Adaptation rules**

* **Step‑up/step‑down:** adjust difficulty based on recent outcomes.
* **Bandwidth bias:** prefer 5/10/20‑min variants that match selections.
* **Timing bias:** favor times that worked.
* **Friction dampener:** reduce novelty/difficulty after stressy notes.
* **Ritual protection:** don’t replace a streaking ritual—rotate variety around it.

**Privacy & trust**

* Default to on‑device computation; minimal child data (first name + age band).
* Clear “Because… therefore we suggest…” explanations.
* Controls to pause learning, clear history, export/delete.

---

## Success criteria

* **Daily:** ≥60% of days with at least one action completed in an active Focus.
* **Weekly:** ≥70% of weeks with a Keep/Adjust decision.
* **Monthly:** ≥80% accept ≥2 of 3 auto‑proposed blocks.
* **Qualitative:** notes mention less friction or more initiative within 4–6 weeks.

---

## Anti‑patterns to avoid

* Turning the deck into a settings panel (too many axes at once).
* Chasing points/badges over meaning (show **streaks & stories**, not scores).
* Over‑rotating themes before habits stick (protect rituals).
* Copy that scolds or implies failure.
* Treating crisis states like ordinary coaching (surface a calm‑down kit and opt out of scoring when in crisis).

---

## Naming ideas (the “parenting view”)

* **Compass** (or **Family Compass**)
* **Focus Board**
* **Pathways**
* **North Star**

---

## Glossary

* **Building block:** one of Micro‑skill, Ritual, Support.
* **Micro‑skill:** a small, coachable behavior (e.g., “try first, ask for help after”).
* **Ritual:** a predictable time‑boxed practice (e.g., “feelings check‑in at dinner”).
* **Support:** environment/context helper (e.g., “two choices laid out”).
* **Rung:** a plain‑language competency step (not a score).

---

## Enrichment Pack (optional, ready to drop in)

### A) Copy & Tone Mini‑Guide

* **Rationale line** template: *“Why this helps: \[need] → \[tiny mechanism].”*
  Examples:

  * Independence → “Offering two choices increases **autonomy** without losing **structure**.”
  * Emotion Skills → “Naming your feeling first gives **permission** and models **language**.”
* **Effort‑praise** starters: “You stuck with it…”, “You tried first…”, “You noticed and adjusted when…”.
* **Non‑shamey redirects:** “Let’s make it smaller.” / “Try again later.” / “Different day, different energy—good call.”

### B) Focus Area Starter Libraries (v1)

**Independence**

* **5‑min:** Child chooses between two outfits; parent waits 30s before helping.
* **10‑min:** Child starts snack prep; parent is backup.
* **20‑min:** Child leads simple chore sequence (laundry sort → start machine).
  Tags: choice‑making, initiation, sequences; Difficulty: 1→3.

**Emotion Skills**

* **5‑min:** “I feel… because…” + invite child’s feeling.
* **10‑min:** Feelings chart check‑in after school.
* **20‑min:** Story time: find the character’s feeling + body clue.
  Tags: labeling, co‑regulation, perspective; Difficulty: 1→3.

> Add 6–10 templates per Focus with tags and contraindications (e.g., “skip if child is dysregulated”).

### C) Signals & Rules (concrete)

* **SuccessRate(tag):** completed / shown (7‑day rolling).
* **FrictionIndex:** % of “hard” + notes with stress keywords. If >40% for 3 days → apply **Friction dampener** (–novelty, –difficulty for 3 days).
* **NoveltyTolerance:** prefers new templates if completion doesn’t drop when novelty↑.
* **Step Ladder:** promote if ≥3/4 successes with ≤1 “hard”; demote if ≥2/4 “hard” or skips.

### D) Analytics Events (privacy‑first)

* `focus.activate` (id)
* `today.shown` (templates\[]) / `today.pick` (templateId, variant) / `today.complete|snooze|skip`
* `today.reflect` (difficulty)
* `week.choice` (keep|scale\_down|scale\_up)
* `month.accept_blocks` (count)

### E) Notification Tone Bank (use sparingly)

* Evening: “Want a tiny win for **{Focus}** tonight? Two 5‑min options inside.”
* Morning (opt‑in): “Pick one small **{Focus}** nudge for today.”
* Weekly digest: “Win • What’s Hard • Suggested tweak for **{Focus}**—2 taps.”

### F) Accessibility & Inclusion Non‑negotiables

* Dynamic Type throughout; 44pt touch targets; VoiceOver labels on toggles and chips.
* Motion‑reduced animations; color not sole carrier of meaning.
* Plain‑language reading level ≈ grade 6–8; translate idioms.

### G) Crisis Flow (opt‑out of scoring)

* Detect elevated FrictionIndex + repeated “Overwhelmed” notes → suggest **Coping Kit**; pause scoring and novelty; surface repair scripts; add “resume coaching” toggle.

### H) Co‑Parent Digest (weekly template)

* **Focus recap:** Win • What’s Hard • Tweak
* **Plan snapshot:** Micro‑skill, Ritual, Support
* **Vote:** Keep / Adjust (links to Monthly Plan)

### I) Success Targets (MVP)

* Daily completion ≥60% of active‑Focus days
* Keep/Adjust participation ≥70% of weeks
* 2/3 building blocks accepted ≥80% of months

### J) File placement & cross‑links
